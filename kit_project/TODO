//DONE Changing the approval of a submission easily from the view

//DONE - Export wont fail, but submission won't show in list -If the contact is not registered with the correct backend, and is not recog
nized when the sms is sent, it will cause the export to fail, and deleting submissions does not work !


The app doesnt recognize the correct group of the sending agent, which leads to the wrong response being
sent - It seems that the message connection has the correct group defined in it because it shows up in
the view submission. But the response sent by the console is for the group restriction. 
    Can do a temporary hack to keep the message for restriction the same as the message for correct 
    group, but this needs to be fixed.

only allow certain views to be seen by users who aren't staff

only show reporters belonging to the logged in users group

Remove the poll application

//DONE have a system where there are certain users/contacts (managers) who when they login
can (or cannot) access admin, but when they click on the report tab, then only the report submissions
