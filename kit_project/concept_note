The RapidSMS system for monitoring of WASH/CLTS is based on the health agents
that go out into the field, and collect data about the progress of CLTS in their
assigned locations. 

The system will have the each reporter identified by his phone number in the system,
and associated with a group (NGO). Once the reporter goes out to the field, he will 
text in the data associated with that location which will then be recorded. These 
submissions will need to be approved by the local NGO manager through a web interface
before they are used in the report.

The local NGO is responsible for maintaining a log of their health reporters, their phone
numbers, and the locations that they will be reporting from. This should not be difficult
as the names and locations are already on file, only the sms numbers need to be added.
